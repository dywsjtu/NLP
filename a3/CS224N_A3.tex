\textbf{(a)}\\
\textbf{(i)}\\
The momentum increases for dimensions whose gradients point in the same directions and reduces updates for dimensions whose gradients change directions. By using m, we can gain faster convergence and reduced oscillation
\\
\textbf{(ii)}\\
Weights that receive high gradients will have their effective learning rate reduced and Weights that receive small / infrequent updates will have effective learning rate increased\\
